/* This file is meant to be used with the MATLAB arduino IO 
   package, however, it can be used from the IDE environment
   (or any other serial terminal) by typing commands like:
   
   0e0 : assigns digital pin #4 (e) as input
   0f1 : assigns digital pin #5 (f) as output
   0n1 : assigns digital pin #13 (n) as output   
   
   1c  : reads digital pin #2 (c) 
   1e  : reads digital pin #4 (e) 
   2n0 : sets digital pin #13 (n) low
   2n1 : sets digital pin #13 (n) high
   2f1 : sets digital pin #5 (f) high
   2f0 : sets digital pin #5 (f) low
   4j2 : sets digital pin #9 (j) to  50=ascii(2) over 255
   4jz : sets digital pin #9 (j) to 122=ascii(z) over 255
   3a  : reads analog pin #0 (a) 
   3f  : reads analog pin #5 (f) 

   R0    : sets analog reference to DEFAULT
   R1    : sets analog reference to INTERNAL
   R2    : sets analog reference to EXTERNAL
  
   X3    : roundtrip example case returning the input (ascii(3)) 
   99    : returns script type (0 adio.pde ... 3 motor.pde ) */
